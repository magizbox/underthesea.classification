\begin{abstract}
In this report, we describe our classification system for Vietnamese, which is integrated in underthesea version 1.1.8. Our system is open-source and available at
\href{https://github.com/undertheseanlp/classification}{https://github.com/undertheseanlp/classification}

\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Text classification is an important task in Natural Language Processing with many applications, such as web search, information retrieval, ranking and document classification.

In recent years, natural language processing and text classification have had a lot of works with encouraging results of research comminity in side and outsite Vietnam. The relevant works outside Vietnam have been published a lot.

\section{System Description}

We takes some experiments in Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM ~\cite{Suykens1999}, fasttext models ~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/JoulinGBM16}.

\subsection{SVM}

SVM algorithm works by creating support vectors that separating two classes in n-dimensional space, where each dimension is represented by a feature. The separation is done by finding the largest separation margin between  the features from the two classes and a vector.

\subsection{FastText}

FastText maps each vocabulary to a real-valued vector, with unknown words having a special vocabulary ID. A document can be represented as the average of all these vectors. Then FastText will train a maximum entropy multi-class classifier  on the vectors and the output labels.

\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Data sets}

\noindent \textbf{VNTC} ~\cite{DBLP:conf/rivf/HoangDNN07}: A Vietnamese corpus based on the four largest
circulation Vietnamese online newspapers: VnExpress, TuoiTre Online, Thanh Nien Online, Nguoi Lao Dong Online. The collected texts are automatically preprocessed (removing the HTML tags, spelling normalization) by Teleport software and various heuristics. There followed a stage of manual correction by linguists (five master students in Linguistics of University of Social Sciences, VNU-HCM city, Vietnam) who reviewed and adjusted the documents which are
classified to the wrong topics. Final relatively large and sufficient corpus includes about 100,000 documents.

\subsection{Evaluation Measures}

We used Precision, Recall, F1 score as evaluation measures.

$$F_1 = \frac{2*P*R}{P + R}$$

\noindent where P (Precision), and R (Recall) are determined as follows:

$$P = \frac{\textrm{the text number classified by the model correctly}}{\textrm{the text number classified correctly in practice}}$$

$$R = \frac{\textrm{the text number classified by the model correctly}}{\textrm{the text number classified by the model}}$$

\subsection{Results}

Table ~\ref{tab:result} show result on each system in VNTC dataset.

\begin{table}

  \begin{tabular}{cccc}
    \toprule
    Method & P & R & F1 \\
    \midrule
    Fasttext  & 0.86 & 0.86 & 0.85 \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}

  \label{tab:result}

\end{table}

\section{Conclusions}

There are a lot of thing you we to try in next version. We want to explore text classification tutorial of Google\footnote{\href{https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/text-classification/}{Google Text Classification Tutorial}}, which has more details to build text classification system.
